INTRODUCTION                                          *rails_locale_alternate*

Makes it easier to open alternate Rails locale files. While editing a locale
file, you may want to reference the translations of another language. This
plugin provides commands to open a different language version of the current
locale file in a separate window.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                     *rails_locale_alternate-commands*

						*RailsLocaleAlternate*
:RailsLocaleAlternate {language-code}
		Open an alternate language Rails locale file based on the
		current buffer. The {language-code} must be a two-letter

<		This opens the French version of the current locale file in a
		new split.

:ERailsLocaleAlternate {language-code}
		Same as ":RailsLocaleAlternate", but opens in the current
		buffer.

		split.

:VRailsLocaleAlternate {language-code}
